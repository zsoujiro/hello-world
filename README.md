I'm learning this because gthub is a very useful tool to mantain different versions of the same thing in an ordered manner.

I like the order because the order brings peace. And I like the peace. The world would be a happy place if everybody make what it has. I'm the kind of person that believe that one day, very soon, the world will be filled with peace, so everybody that likes the peace will enjoy that. Of course, for the peace to make sense the freedom should keep continue to exist.

But the people will take good decissions always because they will be trained by the one that creates the world, so we will have the best of the teachers.
